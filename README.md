This EDA demonstrates that Algeria's labor market data tells a story far richer than employment statistics alone. The patterns of missing data, the evolution of gender-disaggregated statistics, and the cyclical nature of data quality all reflect the country's complex journey through socialism, civil conflict, economic reform, and political transformation.
The analysis reveals three fundamental challenges requiring immediate attention: a youth employment crisis that threatens social stability, persistent gender exclusion that wastes human capital, and the lack of data collection during the years as well as the influence of certain events on this specific data set. Most critically, the data suggests that Algeria's demographic dividend - its large young population - risks becoming a demographic burden without urgent, comprehensive policy intervention.
The visualization patterns provide a roadmap for understanding not just what happened in Algeria's labor market, but why traditional predictive approaches are insufficient for countries undergoing fundamental institutional transformation. The story embedded in missing data may be as valuable as the story told by available data.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:

Identify missing value patterns across different years and indicators.

Showcase the influence of Historical events on the country labor

Adress the lack of data during the years

We explore:

Missing values per year 

Missing values per indicator 

Visual insights using matplotlib and seaborn 

 Data Source
The dataset used is:
AlgeriaLaborData.csv â€” a structured CSV file containing labor indicators across multiple years which was found of kaggle 

 Make sure to place the dataset in the expected input directory, or update the path if needed.

 Author Notes
- This process was made for the goal to make a future economic article , as an e-management and economics student I search the Algerian market and adress the market problem
- The female gender data was missing severly compared to the male gender values
- some major events were used for analysis
